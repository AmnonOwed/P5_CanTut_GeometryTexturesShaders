Geometry, Textures & Shaders Tutorial for CAN
===================================

Examples for an upcoming tutorial I'm preparing for [CreativeApplications.net](http://www.creativeapplications.net/).
This is work-in-progress source code! Still searching for the exact focus of the blog post.
All code examples built with [Processing 1.5.1.](http://processing.org/download/) and in some cases [GLGraphics 1.0.0](http://glgraphics.sourceforge.net/)
Once Processing 2.0 final is out, I'll port these code examples to the new & improved OpenGL renderer.

####Custom2DGeometry
Creating a custom 2D shape with interpolated colors using beginShape-vertex-endShape

####DynamicTextures2D
Creating textured QUADS with dynamically generated texture coordinates

####Texture2DAnimation
 Creating an animation by using texture coordinates to read from a spritesheet

####TexturedSphere
 Creating a correctly textured sphere by subdividing an icosahedron. Using GLGraphics to store / display the shape.

####Shaders
(TBD) Applying shaders to 3D geometry using the GLGraphics library
