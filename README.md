Geometry, Textures & Shaders Tutorial for CAN
===================================

Examples for an upcoming tutorial I'm preparing for [CreativeApplications.net] (http://www.creativeapplications.net/).

This is work-in-progress source code! Still searching for the exact focus of the blog post.

####Custom2DGeometry
Creating a custom 2D shape with interpolated colors using beginShape-vertex-endShape

####DynamicTextures2D
Creating textured QUADS with dynamically generated texture coordinates

####Texture2DAnimation
 Creating an animation by using texture coordinates to read from a spritesheet

####Shaders
(TBD) Applying shaders to 3D geometry using the GLGraphics library
